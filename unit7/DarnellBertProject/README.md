# Unit 7: Course Project Part 3

## Activities

Students must make their Class Project Part 3 submissions by the end of this unit, Sunday, Unit 7, at midnight (24:00 pm) CST. A reminder of the narrative for this class project is given below.

Remember to present:

- A final version of the ERD and the relational database model for the project with all corrections requested by the instructor.
- A sql-dump file containing the corrected and final version of the MariaDB database for the project.
- Three “.java” or “.py” files containing the requested programs in this final part of the project. The programs should compile and produce the required report tables when run.

## Questions

Students may also use this discussion thread to share ideas and ask questions about the project. Please share ideas and not the actual projects.
Unit 5 – Course Project Part 3 – Description  (Reminder)

## Objective

The purpose of the third and last part of the class project is to create application programs that interact with the MariaDB database that was implemented in the second part.

## Guidelines

Students must do the following:

Review and implement any corrections to the database given by the instructor in the grading of the second part.

Write 3 Java or Python programs that will display the information related to tables from 3 of the 4 associative entities in the project design. Each program will display a report table with all important and descriptive information regarding a relationship. For example, if the database design includes an associative entity that describes the orders made by a Client entity from a Supplier entity, then all attributes in the associative entity must be displayed in the report table, but also the full names of the Client and the Supplier. These names will probably not be inside the table for the associative entity, but they can be pulled from related tables. Students must show their good own criteria in deciding which attributes are important or descriptive enough to be displayed in their report tables. It is recommended that for every program, students should formulate a SQL query that would display the required report. Once this is defined, it would be easier to write a Java or Python program that will execute the query and handle the output to produce the report table. The report table should label correctly each of its columns at the top and report all records in the associative entities.

Name each of your programs starting with the student’s last name, followed by the student’s first name, and the word “ProgX”, where X will be the number 1, 2, or 3, for each of the three programs. For example, if the student’s name is Jane Doe, her programs must be named “DoeJaneProg1.java”, “DoeJaneProg2.java”, and “DoeJaneProg3.java” (or “DoeJaneProg1.py”, “DoeJaneProg2.py”, and “DoeJaneProg3.py”
).

# Deliverables

Every submission must include:

- A final version of the ERD and the relational database model for the project with all corrections requested by the instructor.
- A sql-dump file containing the corrected and final version of the MariaDB database for the project.
- Three “.java” or ".py" files containing the requested programs in this final part of the project. The programs should compile and produce the required report tables when run.
