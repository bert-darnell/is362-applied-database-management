# IS362DLS2A2024 Applied Database Management

## Course Description
Welcome to IS362, Applied Data Management!

After discovering the foundations of Data Management, this course provides hands-on experience in the creation, manipulation, programming, and administration of an operational database management system, MariaDB. MariaDB is a relational database management system that is SQL-based. Most relational databases use SQL as their operational language. Learning this language is one of the most important skills a student may have, since interaction with most structured databases in existence today uses this language.

Students will learn to create, populate, and modify databases with their tables and their relations. Students also will learn to obtain information from the database using SQL queries. They will write commands directly into MariaDB, but also will learn to write programs that will perform these commands for them. Finally, students will learn operational commands to administer databases day-to-day operations like user rights, batch uploading of information and database backups. Exposure to this set of subjects will provide students a practical and well-rounded experience in the management of current relational databases.
