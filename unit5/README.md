# Unit 5

## Purpose

The purpose of this assignment is to explore Java or Python Programming to access MariaDB Databases. Students will choose only one of these languages to write their programs for this assignment.

## Activities

In this assignment, students will work with the same design for a transport company given in the previous unit (shown again at the end of this document). You are not giving a sql-dump this time, but rather a text file containing the commands that can be used to create the database Preparation Commands

Download Preparation Commands. Students may use these commands as a reference for this assignment. Students must do the following:

- Select two tables within the design that are related by a primary key-foreign key relation.
- Create an empty database named assig05 in MariaDB.
- Write a Java or Python program with a name that contains the student’s last name, first name, and the word “Assig05”. For example, if the student’s name is Jane Doe, her program must be named “DoeJaneAssig05.java” (or “DoeJaneAssig05.py”). This program will create the two tables selected in 1 inside the database from 2. The program should create all fields in both tables with appropriate types. It should also populate fully both tables with all the records shown in the text file with the instructions. Students must also create the primary key-foreign key relationship between tables.

## Deliverables

Students will submit the “.java” file or the “.py” file with their program. The program should compile and produce the required tables in the required database when run.

# Unit Learning Outcomes Reflected In Assignment

Write simple programs to access a relational database management to create and populate a database (CLO 3).
