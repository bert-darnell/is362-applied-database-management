Activities

Students must make their Class Project Part 2 submissions by the end of this week, Sunday, Week 5, at midnight (24:00 pm) CST. A reminder of the narrative for this class project is given below.

Remember to present:

    A corrected version of the relational database model that describes the MariaDB database presented in this part of the project.
    A sql-dump file containing a backup of the implemented database in this part of the project.

All submissions must include diagrams drawn professionally. These can be created using Microsoft Word, Excel, or PowerPoint. PDF files are also welcomed for the diagrams. The sql-dump file is by nature a text file.

Submissions will be graded during Unit 6 and returned to students, so that they can proceed with requested modifications to be implemented for Class Project –Part 3 - Final (due at the end of Unit 7).
Unit 4 – Class Project Part 2 – Description  (Reminder)

Objective

The purpose of the second part of the class project is to create a MariaDB database based on the revised design from the first part.

Guidelines

Students must do the following:

    Review and implement the corrections indicated by the instructor in the grading of part 1. These may include:

    Addition, modification, or elimination of tables and or relations.
    Name changes for fields, tables, and relationships
    Change of cardinality in relationships

      Implementation of these corrections should be reflected in the construction of a new relational database model to be included in the deliverables for the submission of part 2.

    Create a MariaDB database that reflects the corrected relational database model. Names of tables and fields must agree with the names given in the relational database model. All tables and primary key-foreign key relations must be implemented.

    Populate the tables in the created database. Each table representing a strong entity must contain at least 20 records. Any table for a weak entity may contain a lesser amount of records, but they should be enough to make the database look realistic. Each table representing an associative relationship should include at least one record per each of the records of the entities that participate in the relationship. Since every strong entity may have 20 unique records, this means that associative entities that reference them may also contain 20 or more records.

    Be sure that Entity and Referential integrities are preserved in the database, meaning that no primary key may accept duplicate values and every foreign key should reference a proper primary key (no null foreign keys should be present in this database).

Deliverables

Every submission must include:

    A corrected version of the relational database model that describes the MariaDB database presented in this part of the project.
    A sql-dump file containing a backup of the implemented database in this part of the project.

All submissions must include diagrams drawn professionally. These can be created using Microsoft Word, Excel, or PowerPoint. PDF files are also welcomed for the diagrams. The sql-dump file is by nature a text file.

Deadline

Students have two weeks to prepare and submit their work for this project. (Unit 4 and Unit 5). Submissions are due on Sunday, Week 5, at midnight (24:00 pm) CST.
