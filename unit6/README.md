# Unit 6

## Purpose

The purpose of this assignment is to explore Java or Python Programming to query MariaDB Databases. Students will choose only one of these languages to write their programs for this assignment.

## Activities

In this assignment, once again, students will work with the same design for a transport company previously given (with the design shown again at the end of this document). You may use the MySQL dump file named “ForAssig06-dump.sql

Download ForAssig06-dump.sql”. You must import this file into a database named “ForAssig06”. This way your program can be evaluated for grading. After importing the database, students must do the following:

- Design a query command (SELECT) that involves at least three tables within the design that are related by primary key-foreign key relations. This command should display most (if not all) fields in the tables involved and should limit the number of records to 5 or more by the use of conditional statements in the WHERE clause. Test the query in the database.
- Write a Java or Python program with a name that contains the student’s last name, first name, and the word “Assig06”. For example, if the student’s name is John Doe, his program must be named “DoeJaneAssig06.java” (or “DoeJaneAssig06.java”). This program will perform the query designed in 1. The program should produce (display) a report table with all the fields obtained in the query. The report table should label correctly each of its columns at the top and report all requested records generated in the query.

## Deliverables

Students will submit the “.java” file or the “.py” file with their program. The program should compile and produce the required tables in the database provided when run.

## Unit Learning Outcomes Reflected In Assignment

Write simple programs to query a relational database management system (CLO 3).
